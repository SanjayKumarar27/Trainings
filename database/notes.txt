Database:
ef codd
data dictionary : meta data about the commamd name and definations it has
Read about the ef codd rules to better undersanding for data base 
in excel we have onesigle user updation is allowed other can only open in read only mode cant support 
no scalable in excel ,Acess
more scable in mqsql,rdbms(mostly centralised ,vertical database)
most scable in mongodb,nosql(mostly distributed , horizontal database)

only for 
sys.tables === show tables 
mdf:primary only one is allowed 
ndf:secondary next all the other database is ndf
ldf : Log file  (to discussed while transcations)
are the excentention for the database


atleast one mdf,and ldf to create database 

diffrence between
database: list of file mdf,ndf,ldf,
dbms: software which manage database(oracel sequel server)
sql:querry language


what is instance in database
instance is service which help to connect to database
. is default server its name is "MSSQLServer"
.is  current 
./name 
while connecting to the database we connect to instance of that database which inter connect to the instance

ie MSSQLSERVER here we have one instance - has multiple database
in oracle it had one to one instance per database 
after 12 c we have multiple dataebaser per instance

System database	Description
master Database	Records all the system-level information for an instance of SQL Server.

msdb Database	Is used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs.

model Database	Is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database, such as database size, collation, recovery model, and other database options, are applied to any databases created afterward.

Resource Database	Is a read-only database that contains system objects that are included with SQL Server. System objects are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the sys schema of every database.
    -> this store the data catalog or data dictionary

tempdb Database: Is a workspace for holding temporary objects or intermediate result sets.
