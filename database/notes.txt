Database:
ef codd
data dictionary : meta data about the commamd name and definations it has
Read about the ef codd rules to better undersanding for data base 
in excel we have onesigle user updation is allowed other can only open in read only mode cant support 
no scalable in excel ,Acess
more scable in mqsql,rdbms(mostly centralised ,vertical database)
most scable in mongodb,nosql(mostly distributed , horizontal database)

only for 
sys.tables === show tables 
mdf:primary only one is allowed 
ndf:secondary next all the other database is ndf
ldf : Log file  (to discussed while transcations)
are the excentention for the database


atleast one mdf,and ldf to create database 

diffrence between
database: list of file mdf,ndf,ldf,
dbms: software which manage database(oracel sequel server)
sql:querry language


what is instance in database
instance is service which help to connect to database
. is default server its name is "MSSQLServer"
.is  current 
./name 
while connecting to the database we connect to instance of that database which inter connect to the instance

ie MSSQLSERVER here we have one instance - has multiple database
in oracle it had one to one instance per database 
after 12 c we have multiple dataebaser per instance

System database	Description
master Database	Records all the system-level information for an instance of SQL Server.

msdb Database	Is used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs.

model Database	Is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database, such as database size, collation, recovery model, and other database options, are applied to any databases created afterward.

Resource Database	Is a read-only database that contains system objects that are included with SQL Server. System objects are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the sys schema of every database.
    -> this store the data catalog or data dictionary

tempdb Database: Is a workspace for holding temporary objects or intermediate result sets.

==================================================
DATABASE BASICS & TERMINOLOGY
==================================================

- **E.F. Codd**: Father of the relational database model.  
  - *Tip*: Read about E.F. Codd's 12 rules for a better understanding of relational databases.

- **Data Dictionary**: Metadata about the database, including command names and definitions.  
  - *Definition*: A data dictionary stores information about the structure of the database (tables, columns, data types, etc.).

- **Excel vs. Databases**:
  - Excel: Only one user can update at a time; others are read-only. Not scalable.
  - Access/MySQL/RDBMS: More scalable, centralized (vertical scaling).
  - MongoDB/NoSQL: Most scalable, distributed (horizontal scaling).

==================================================
DATABASE FILES & EXTENSIONS
==================================================

- **sys.tables**: Shows all tables in the database (SQL Server).
- **Database File Extensions**:
  - **.mdf**: Primary data file (only one per database, mandatory).
  - **.ndf**: Secondary data files (optional, can be multiple).
  - **.ldf**: Log file (required for transactions and recovery).

- *Note*: At least one .mdf and one .ldf are required to create a database.

- **Difference between terms**:
  - **Database**: Collection of files (.mdf, .ndf, .ldf).
  - **DBMS**: Software that manages databases (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server).
  - **SQL**: Structured Query Language, used to interact with databases.

==================================================
DATABASE INSTANCE
==================================================

- **Instance**: A service that allows connections to a database.
  - The default SQL Server instance is named "MSSQLServer".
  - "." refers to the current/default instance.
  - "./name" can be used to specify a named instance.
  - One instance can host multiple databases (in SQL Server).
  - In Oracle (pre-12c): One instance per database.
  - In Oracle (12c+): Multiple databases per instance.

==================================================
SQL LANGUAGE COMPONENTS
==================================================

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines structure
  - CREATE
  - ALTER
  - DROP

- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulates data
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE

- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Manages transactions
  - COMMIT
  - ROLLBACK
  - SAVEPOINT

SYSTEM DATABASES IN SQL SERVER
==================================================

| Database         | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| master           | Records all system-level information for an instance of SQL Server.                              |
| msdb             | Used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs.                                         |
| model            | Template for all databases created on the instance. Changes here affect new databases.           |
| Resource         | Read-only; contains system objects (data catalog/data dictionary) that appear in every database. |
| tempdb           | Workspace for holding temporary objects or intermediate result sets.                             |

==================================================
QUICK TIPS
==================================================

- Use **sys.tables** to list all tables in SQL Server.
- Always have at least one .mdf (primary) and one .ldf (log) file for a database.
- Understand the difference between database, DBMS, and SQL.
- Know the roles of system databases in SQL Server for administration and troubleshooting.
- Review E.F. Codd's rules for relational database fundamentals.
